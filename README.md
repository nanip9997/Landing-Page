Create a Basic Landing Page

A Basic Landing page to showcase my front-end skills using HTML and CSS.
Used 'flex' properties to create space-between , to stack different elements vertically , 
Used justify-content, align-items to center 'div' elements content , 
Used width and height to design the containers as required.
